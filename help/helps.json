Discover the power of apps and tools.\nTo use the Salesforce app for Slack, a Salesforce System Administrator will first need to install and configure the Slack package in Salesforce. The package is compatible with the Salesforce Lightning and Classic Experiences, and supports Sales Cloud and Service Cloud.\n\nInstalling and configuring the Slack package using the Slack Setup assistant ensures that all users in your Salesforce org can use the Salesforce app in Slack to set up alerts for both standard and custom objects.\n\nNote:\u00a0If you use Salesforce Professional, you need the API Access add-on to use Slack and Salesforce together.\n\nTo use components in Lightning, your Salesforce org must have a custom domain.\n\nNote: Any links to your Salesforce org with your old domain will redirect to the new custom domain automatically.\n\nNote: If your installation takes more than a couple of minutes, Salesforce will send you an email when it's complete.\n\nOnce the Slack package is installed to Salesforce, it\u2019s important that System Administrators apply the Slack Standard User permission set for all users in your Salesforce org that update record data. Applying this permission set grants users access to Slack actions in your Salesforce org and lets them trigger notifications when records are created or updated. To assign the permission set to Salesforce users, follow the steps below:\n\nSalesforce Lightning\n\nSalesforce Classic\n\nAfter the Slack package is installed to Salesforce and users have been assigned the permission set, use the Setup Assistant to configure the connection between your Salesforce org and Slack. You\u2019ll also have the option to configure the settings below:\n\nIf you don't need to configure a particular setting, click\u00a0Continue to start the step, then click\u00a0Finish to move on to the next one.\u00a0\n\nNote: To enable custom objects, make sure you're using Salesforce package version 1.56 or higher.\n\nEnabling a custom object allows you to add Slack actions and the Slack Message Viewer to custom page layouts, and lets members of your workspace subscribe to alerts in Slack. You must enable custom objects before proceeding to the next step to set up custom alerts. This step will only work for custom objects that are not included in the standard set.\n\nOnce a custom object is activated, you can add the Slack actions and Slack Message Viewer when setting up page layouts\u00a0,and create custom alerts.\u00a0\n\nNote: Once you activate a custom object, it cannot be deactivated.\n\nNote: To set up custom alerts, make sure you're using Salesforcepackage version 1.56 or higher.\n\nA System Administrator can configure custom alerts to expand the default alerts in the package. Once created, members of your Slack workspace or Salesforce org can choose to subscribe to these custom alerts as they would for other object- or record-level alerts.\u00a0\n\nConfigure page layouts in Salesforce to send information between Slack and Salesforce.\u00a0\n\nNote: To remove actions from page layouts, you'll need to use the Object Manager in Salesforce Setup.\n\nThere are two types of Salesforce actions available to configure \u2014\u00a0Send to Slack and\u00a0Slack Alerts. You can add the\u00a0Send to Slack action to individual page layouts, or global layouts so it's visible on all pages. To add actions to your page layouts, follow these steps:\u00a0\n\nTo view Slack messages in Salesforce, add the Slack Message Viewer component to your page layouts. Please note that the Message Viewer component is only supported for standard objects in Salesforce Classic.\u00a0\n\nTip: If you don't see Lightning record pages to choose from, you'll need to create them for your Salesforce org.\n\nIf you'd like, you can create custom message destinations to send Salesforce information to specific Slack conversations from Process Builder or Flow templates.\u00a0\n\nNote: If you're on the Slack Enterprise Grid plan, you'll need to sign in to each workspace you'd like to set message destinations for.\n\nOnce you've set up a message destination, follow the steps below to configure a Process or Lightning Flow to send a Salesforce record to Slack:\n\nThere are two settings you can change to manage how notifications are sent from Salesforce to Slack:\n\nTo update these settings, follow the steps below:\u00a0\n\n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

You\u2019ll find answers to common questions about imports below, so read on to learn more.\u00a0\n\nThere are a few terms to know when preparing to run a Slack import:\n\nWorkspace Owners/Admins and Org Owners can export data from Slack. Workspace Owners can import data to Slack. Keep in mind that data imports are not available for the Slack Enterprise Grid plan.\n\nNote: Only Workspace Owners and Org Owners can apply to export data from all channels and conversations in Slack.\n\nTo merge your workspaces, export user and channel data from the origin workspace, then use Slack's import tool to move this data to the destination workspace. For step-by-step instructions, visit\u00a0Import data from one Slack workspace to another.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a maximum amount of data you can import, but there is a limit to the amount of data the tool can process at once. You may need to split your export file into multiple date ranges and run multiple imports, or consider importing less data. If you\u2019re having any trouble, contact us for help planning your import.\n\nWe don\u2019t support imports to Enterprise Grid organizations. As an alternative, you can import data to a separate workspace, then migrate that workspace to your org. If you need to import an export file from your Enterprise Grid org, please contact us for help.\n\nNo. Workspace settings, preferences, access and security configurations, and other customizations (e.g., user groups, emoji, profile fields, and channel prefixes) must be set up in the destination workspace.\n\nNo, apps must be set up in the destination workspace after the import has completed. For step-by-step instructions on installing apps, visit Add an app to your workspace.\n\nTo be imported, both the user who shared the file and the conversation where it was shared must be imported. However, files added to Slack via apps (e.g., Google Drive, Box, etc.) will never be imported.\n\nPinned messages will be imported along with their corresponding channels. Users\u2019 saved messages and files will not be imported.\n\nTo test the import process, create a new workspace using the free version of Slack. Upload your export file to the new workspace to view and test the import options.\n\nTesting the import process won't provide a reliable time estimate for how long your import will take on another workspace, as the conditions and data sets may vary. When you're done testing, you can delete the workspace.\n\nNote: When choosing import options for members, be sure to select Create as deactivated users so people don't receive invitations to join your test workspace.\n\nAfter you upload your export file, you can choose how you import users. You can set users to merge with accounts in your destination workspace or invite users as new Slack members. You can also create accounts for deactivated users or choose not to import certain users at all.\n\nThis depends on how you import the user. It\u2019s not possible to import users as Workspace Owners or Workspace Admins. If you merge users, they will retain their roles in the destination workspace. Any users imported with the Import and invite to Slack option will be members by default. Once your import is complete, a Workspace Owner or Workspace Admin can change the role of any member in the workspace.\n\nNote: Wait until your import has completed before changing user roles. Changing user roles in the destination workspace while the import is running may cause it to fail.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to merge a user into an existing guest account and guests can only be imported as full members or deactivated members. Once the import is complete, you can convert the member to a guest, or reactivate the member as a guest.\n\nYou can choose to import users as deactivated users and reactivate them when the import is complete.\n\nNote: There is no bulk action to reactivate members\u2019 accounts, so you\u2019ll need to reactivate members one at a time. If your workspace is on the Business+ plan, you can use SCIM provisioning to do this more quickly.\n\nIf both the user and the channel are set to be imported, the user will be added to the channel they were a part of in the origin workspace. This will happen at the very end of the import process, after all messages and files are finished importing.\n\nNote: The person performing the import may be added to channels and appointed as the channel creator.\n\nExternal users who have sent messages in channels shared with external organizations in the origin workspace will not be visible in the user import options and cannot be imported. Their messages will automatically import if the corresponding channels are also imported, but no user accounts can be merged or created in the destination workspace. Additionally, direct messages (DMs) between external users and members of the origin workspace cannot be imported.\n\nAfter you upload your export file, you can choose how you import channels. You can merge channels from your export file with existing public channels in the destination workspace, or you can create new public or private channels. To skip importing certain channels, select Don\u2019t import.\n\nNote: It is not possible to merge channels with an existing private channel.\n\nYou can merge channels in your export file with existing public channels in the destination workspace. Messages will be imported chronologically, so they may break up the flow of existing conversations in the destination channel.\n\nYes. You can set certain channels to Don\u2019t import, while setting other channels to Merge with existing channel, Create new public channel, or Create new private channel.\n\nThese channels will be imported as public channels, which you can share with external organizations once the import is complete. Messages sent by external users will be imported, but no accounts will be created for these users on the destination workspace.\n\nYes, but archived channels will be unarchived once imported. Once the import is complete, you can archive these channels again in the destination workspace.\n\nYou can only import direct messages (DMs) from an export file that contains all channels and conversations. In order for a DM to be imported, all the users in the DM must be imported to the destination workspace. In other words, how you choose to import users will affect which DMs are imported:\n\nYou can apply a batch action for all users before starting your import. Keep in mind that if you change the batch action, that import option will apply to all users and overwrite any defaults or individual users\u2019 settings. Here are the batch actions available in the first dropdown menu:\n\n*This option will automatically be selected for external users if you're importing from a workspace with channels shared with people outside your organization. This option can't be changed. Public messages from external users will be visible in your workspace, but their direct messages and files won't be imported, and no accounts will be created for them.\n\nYou select an option for an individual user before starting your import. Here are the individual import options available:\n\nYou can apply a batch action for all channels before starting your import. Keep in mind that if you change the batch action, that import option will apply to all users and overwrite any defaults or individual channels\u2019 settings. Here are the batch actions available in the first dropdown menu:\n\n*This only applies to public channels, unless you\u2019re importing an export file containing all channels and conversations. If you\u2019ve performed an export for all channels and conversations, you can import both public and private channels to your destination workspace. You can also choose to import direct messages at this stage.\n\nYou select an option for an individual channel before starting your import. Here are the individual import options available:\n\nSlack imports are broken up into phases, and processed in this order:\n\nPhases 3 and 4 will run simultaneously, and the import will not move to phase 5 until they are fully completed. It is expected that no users are added to channels until the very end of the import. You\u2019ll receive an email when the import is complete, so you don\u2019t need to keep the import page open in your browser.\n\nYes. Users will be able to access the destination workspace and continue working in it while an import is running. However, users should refrain from taking any channel management actions, such as changing channel names, deleting channels, or converting channels to private or shared. Similarly, Workspace Owners and Workspace Admins should not take any user management actions, like changing members\u2019 roles, editing members\u2019 email addresses, or activating or deactivating accounts. Taking any of these actions can cause the import to fail.\n\nThat depends on the number of channels, users, and files being imported rather than the size of an export file. We cannot provide an estimate for how long an import will take.\n\nYes \u2013 click the Reverse Import button to cancel and reverse an import. This action will remove imported messages, files, and any channels created by the import that haven\u2019t had new messages sent in them. New user accounts created during the import cannot be removed, but they can be deactivated.\n\nTip: If you decide to run a new import after reversing one, you can set users to merge with the existing accounts created by your previous import.\n\nWe always recommend a single import when merging one workspace with another, but there may be circumstances where you need to perform multiple imports. For example, if your exports are too large for the import tool to process, you can download multiple export files, each with a different date range, and perform multiple imports using those files.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to run multiple imports, keep the following in mind:\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to run multiple imports to the same destination workspace, we recommend contacting us to review your import plan with our team.\n\nChannels are created at the beginning of the import with a single channel creator added to them. If the channel creator from the origin workspace is not imported, the person running the import will automatically be added to the channel and listed as the creator. The rest of the channel members will be added during the last phase of the import.\n\nThe most common problem when uploading your export file is that the file has been unzipped, uncompressed, or altered. Make sure that you\u2019re uploading the original zip file you downloaded from the Slack export tool and that it has not been edited.\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble uploading the link to your export file, make sure that you\u2019re using a public direct download link. To check if your link is public, open it in an incognito or private browser window. Your link should trigger a direct download rather than open a web page that prompts you to enter a passphrase.\n\nTo import a message, both the user who sent it and the channel where it was sent must be imported. For example, if you set all channels to Create new public channel and you set all users to Don\u2019t import, the channels will be imported without messages.\n\nIf you used an export file that contains all channels and conversations and chose to import direct messages (DMs), all users in a DM must be imported. If you\u2019ve chosen Import just their messages or Don\u2019t import for any of the users, their DMs will not be imported.\n\nSimilarly, any DMs that include external users from your origin workspace will not be imported. External users will be automatically imported as Import just their messages, and will not have an account created on the destination workspace.\n\nThe best option would be to reverse the import, and run a new import after you\u2019ve corrected the cause of the error. If you\u2019re not sure what caused the error, you can contact us for help. Make sure to include any examples of what didn\u2019t work as expected, or the error message you encountered and we\u2019ll investigate further.\n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

Discover the power of apps and tools.\nWorkflows are automated multi-step tasks or processes \u2014 no coding required! \u2014 that start in your Slack workspace. They can run right in Slack, or connect with other tools and services.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your initial workflow setup, you\u2019ll add and customize steps. Steps in your workflow will be followed in the order you decide, and can be used to collect or send information in Slack, or between Slack and other services.\n\nSteps are a series of actions taken to complete a workflow. Once your workflow starts, it will present the steps you add in the order you specify. There are three types of steps you can add to workflows: messages, forms, and steps from apps installed to your workspace.\n\nSend messages as part of your workflow to communicate information to the person who kicked it off, or others in Slack who need to take action from information submitted to a workflow. Message steps can be used to send direct messages (DMs) to certain people, or post in a channel or thread. Messages in Workflow Builder support automatic message formatting and hyperlinks.\n\nAdd forms to your workflow to organize and collect information. Forms can include space for custom responses, or prompt people to choose options from a list. Once a form has been completed, you can choose to send responses to a channel or a specific person via DM.\n\nNote: Form responses cannot be edited once they\u2019ve been submitted via Workflow Builder.\n\nSome Slack app developers offer custom workflow steps for their apps. Steps from apps are unique, and allow you to connect a workflow in Slack to other services in specific ways. In order to use an app's steps in Workflow Builder, you'll first need to add the app to your workspace, which may require admin approval.\u00a0\n\nWhen an app is added to your workspace, you can connect your account to take actions in another service without leaving Slack. Steps from apps are similar \u2014 by adding a step from an app to a workflow, you can send information collected by your workflow to another service or pull information from that service into Slack. Then, you can reference that information in additional steps of your workflow, or others can take action from the service \u2014 without anyone needing to copy any information between tools. \n\nKeep in mind that app developers choose how the workflow steps for their apps work. In many cases, you can customize steps from apps after adding them to your workflow, but it\u2019s not possible to modify the core experience a step is designed to provide.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to add steps to your workflow, you'll find and add them from the step library in Workflow Builder. You can search for specific steps, or browse all steps available for your workspace.\n\n\n\nTo view steps created by Slack (like message and form steps), click Built by Slack in the left column. Click your organization\u2019s name to see any steps available as part of custom apps built by members of your workspace. Select an app to view workflow steps created by that app\u2019s developer.\u00a0\n\nNote: If an app is installed in your workspace and you aren\u2019t seeing its steps in Workflow Builder, you may need to re-install or request approval for the most updated version.\n\nWhen adding steps to workflows, there may be times you want to reference information submitted to your workflow (like a response to one of the questions in a form, or the name of the person who started the workflow). You may also want your workflow to pause at a certain step while the person using it takes a certain action, or completes a particular task.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can use buttons and variables to customize your workflow steps.\n\nWhen you add a button to a step in your workflow, the workflow won\u2019t proceed until someone clicks the button. Buttons can only be clicked once per workflow, so we don\u2019t recommend adding them to workflows multiple people may need to use \u2014 for example, a scheduled date & time workflow that reminds a team of five people to share their daily status updates on a project.\n\nVariables allow you to insert information from previous steps in your workflow in subsequent steps, giving you even more flexibility to personalize your workflows and connect information across various steps. The variables available to you will depend on how your workflow starts, who interacts with steps at various points, and information passed into the workflow (like responses to a form). If you\u2019re using any steps from apps, you may also be able to use variables unique to those steps.\n\nFollow the steps below to add steps to your workflow and customize them with buttons and variables if you\u2019d like.\n\n\n\nAdd text and buttons or variables to message steps, set up custom forms, and configure steps from apps if you\u2019re using any.\n\nMessage steps\n\nForm steps\n\nSteps from apps\n\n\n\nTip: You can use responses to form questions as variables in any message steps you add to your workflow after a form step.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Set up a workflow\n\n\ud83d\udccd Add steps to a workflow\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Manage workflow collaborators\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Publish a workflow\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Manage a workflow\n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

Read on to learn how to troubleshoot common issues with call connections, audio, video, and screen sharing.\u00a0\n\nNote: The calls test is only available from the Slack desktop app and Slack in Chrome, and cannot be run from a DM with yourself or Slackbot.\n\nOur calls test can help identify problems you may be having while on a Slack call. After running the test, use the troubleshooting information in this article to address any issues flagged in your results. Here's how to run the test:\n\nYour experience with Slack calls depends on the strength of your network connection and your bandwidth:\u00a0\n\n*Requirements are the same when screen sharing\n\nIf your bandwidth meets or exceeds our requirements and you're experiencing issues with call quality, audio cutting in and out, or lag, try one of these options:\u00a0\n\nIf you continue having trouble with audio, video, or screen sharing, skip ahead for more detailed troubleshooting tips.\u00a0\n\nIf Slack is unable to establish a call connection, try these options to narrow down the source of the connection issues:\u00a0\n\nTip: If you're unable to connect to Slack from the desktop app or a browser, visit Troubleshoot connection issues for help.\n\nCalls connection issues may also be caused by an issue with your firewall. If you're experiencing connection errors, you may need to adjust your outbound connection settings:\u00a0\n\nIf your environment requires you to allow Slack's required domains, make sure you approve *.chime.aws.\u00a0\n\nNote:\u00a0We aren't able to provide a list of static domains, only the wildcard.\n\nIf you experience audio issues during a call, quit and reopen the Slack desktop app or your browser. If that doesn\u2019t help, try restarting your device.\n\nIf neither of the options above works, go to your audio and video preferences and check the following:\n\nCheck to make sure your audio isn't muted, then confirm that Slack has permission to access your microphone:\u00a0\n\nMac\n\nWindows\n\nChrome\n\nThere's also a known issue with Windows 10 where Slack cannot detect communications devices (like headphones or headsets) that are not the system default. To set your preferred device as the system default, follow the steps below:\n\nLastly, check that your audio drivers are up to date. If they're not, updating may resolve these issues.\u00a0\n\nNote: If you use a third-party calling app and Slack calls, Slack's access to your microphone may get revoked when switching between the two. You can follow the steps above to re-grant Slack access to your microphone.\n\nHaving issues with video? Quit and reopen the Slack desktop app or your browser. You can also try restarting your device.\n\nIf restarting your device or quitting and reopening Slack doesn't help, try these options:\u00a0\n\nTip:\u00a0If you're using an external camera, make sure to plug it in to your computer before starting a call. If you plug it in after a call has started, video won't display.\u00a0\n\nIf others can't see you on a call, Slack may not have access to your camera. Follow these steps to check your camera permissions:\u00a0\n\nMac\n\nWindows\n\nChrome\n\nYou can also check to make sure your video drivers are up to date. If they're not, updating them may clear up issues.\u00a0\n\nNote: If you notice your computer running slowly during video calls, that may be due to high Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage. For calls with many participants, disabling your video may help speed things up.\n\nIf you're unable to share your screen on the desktop app, use these steps to troubleshoot:\u00a0\n\nMac\n\nWindows\n\nReach out to our Support team and include the following information if you can:\u00a0\n\n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

Discover the power of apps and tools.\nWorkflows are automated multi-step tasks or processes that can run right in Slack, or connect with other tools and services. Workflows in Slack can be as simple or as complex as you\u2019d like, and typically don\u2019t require writing any code.\n\nIf you\u2019re a developer or have some experience with code, you may want to create a workflow triggered by an event in an external service (like an internal tool your company uses) with a webhook.\n\nNote: Owners and admins can restrict access to creating workflows using webhooks. If you don\u2019t see this option in Workflow Builder, find an owner or admin to ask for help.\n\nTip: If you'd like a refresher on how to set up a workflow and choose a trigger, visit Set up a workflow in Slack.\n\nAll workflows in Slack start in response to a trigger. To trigger a workflow using a webhook, you\u2019ll configure the webhook to start your workflow in Slack when an event you specify occurs in another service. For example, you might set up a workflow that posts a message to Slack when there\u2019s a problem with your website or service and an incident has been called to understand and resolve the issues.\n\nThe external service you choose to create and configure your webhook needs to provide you with the ability to make an HTTP POST request to Slack when certain events occur. Slack will generate a unique request URL for your workflow once you publish it, and you can configure your webhook to pass information to Slack via the HTTP request body. Any data your webhook sends to Slack can be referenced in subsequent workflow steps by creating variables.\n\nTip: If you're not sure how to configure your webhook, we recommend asking a developer on your team for help or referencing any support documentation provided by the service you\u2019re using, like Postman or Zapier.\n\nYou can add up to 20 variables to pass data into Slack from another service and include Slack-specific information like display names or email addresses in steps you add to your workflow.\n\nTo create a custom variable, you'll add a key value pair in Workflow Builder as a text-based variable. Once you add a variable, you\u2019ll see a preview of the HTTP body so you can make sure the values match up with the JSON outputs in the other service you\u2019re connecting to Slack via your webhook. Please note that it's not currently possible to use nested JSON structures in workflow variables.\n\nIn the example below, if the user, severity, and incident_description were not sent with your webhook request, the workflow would fail.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTip: If you need to add, remove, or modify variables at any point, open your workflow in Workflow Builder. Then, click Edit next to Webhook to make your changes. You\u2019ll also need to make sure any changes to variables are reflected in the external service your webhook request is sent from.\n\nWhen you publish your workflow, Slack will generate a unique request URL that you can add to your webhook to ensure it sends the POST you set up to the correct channel in Slack. Request URLs start with https://hooks.slack.com/workflows and are followed by a randomized string of characters.\n\nBe sure to keep your request URL secure, as anyone with the link will have the ability to trigger your workflow.\n\nNote: Webhook workflows are limited to one request per second. Learn more about rate limits on Slack API.\n\nOnce you've configured your webhook and created any variables you\u2019d like to use, you're ready to add steps to your workflow.\u00a0\n\nBefore publishing your workflow in a channel members of your workspace are actively using, you can set up the first step to post to a test channel.\n\nIf a webhook\u2019s URL gets exposed or needs to be changed for any reason, follow the steps below:\u00a0\n\nNote: When you regenerate a webhook URL, the connection between your workflow in Slack and another service will break.

The Workflow Builder tutorials guide you through initial setup, adding and customizing steps, publishing, and more. We recommend viewing them in order.\n\n*Advanced technical knowledge is recommended.\n\nCheck out Slack Tips to find a library of workflow ideas and templates you can use to get started. If you're a developer, visit Slack API for details on building workflow steps for a Slack app.\u00a0\n\nIf they'd like, owners and admins can choose to restrict workflow creation permissions to certain members of their workspace or Enterprise Grid organization, and manage access to certain workflow features:\n\nFor more details, visit Manage Workflow Builder access and permissions.\n\nBefore you publish a workflow, it will only be visible to you and any collaborators you\u2019ve added. Once you publish a workflow, Workspace Owners and Admins can view it and add themselves as collaborators. When an owner or admin becomes a collaborator on a workflow, they can edit it, unpublish it, or remove it from Slack entirely. All other collaborators will be notified by Slackbot when a collaborator is added or removed.\n\nNote: If your workflow is in a private channel an owner or admin isn't a member of, they will not be able to see the name of the private channel.\n\nEnterprise Key Management (EKM) customers using Workflow Builder can expect the following data to be encrypted with their keys:\u00a0\n\nIf EKM is enabled for your organization, any workflows created before May 14, 2020 will not be encrypted.

Workspace Owners have several options to manage which apps members can install and use:\n\nWhether app approval is enabled or not, Workspace Owners can limit members to installing apps from the Slack App Directory and prevent guests from using app shortcuts and slash commands. Learn how in Manage app permissions in Slack.\n\nNote: To uninstall an app, follow the instructions in Remove apps and custom integrations from your workspace. If app approval is enabled, uninstalling apps will be limited to Workspace Owners and members with permission to manage app requests.\n\nWorkspace Owners can enable app approval to pre-approve and restrict certain apps for their workspace:\n\nMembers of your workspace can keep using any apps installed before app approval was enabled. To prevent members from using these apps, uninstall them from your workspace.\n\nNote: If you're a Workspace Owner in an Enterprise Grid organization, app approval will automatically be enabled for your workspace if an Org Owner has set an app management policy.\n\nWhen app approval is enabled, members of your workspace can install and use pre-approved apps without submitting an app request. They cannot install or request restricted apps.\n\nPre-approve apps\n\nRestrict apps\n\nMembers can find pre-approved apps from the Approved category in the App Directory.\n\nIf an app you restrict has already been installed to your workspace, members who have connected their accounts can continue using it. To prevent this, you can uninstall the app.\u00a0\n\nWhen app approval is enabled, members can request to install apps that have not been pre-approved, as long as the apps aren\u2019t restricted. Workspace Owners can manage members\u2019 ability to request apps:\n\nNote: If a member of your workspace builds a custom app, they can submit a request to install it. If approved, only the person who submitted the request can install it.\n\nBy default, all app requests will be sent to Workspace Owners via direct messages (DMs) from Slackbot. By routing app requests to a channel and appointing other members (perhaps a few Workspace Admins or people from your IT team) as App Managers, it\u2019s easy to keep track of requests and their approval status.\n\nNote: If Sign in with Slack is enabled for your workspace, members will see the option to sign up for a limited group of verified partners' services after clicking on a link to partners' websites in Slack.\u00a0\n\nSome third-party services offer the option to sign in to their website or app using your Slack account credentials. By default, members cannot sign up for or sign in to other services with their Slack accounts. If they'd like, Workspace Owners can grant members this permission:\u00a0\n\nIf members don't have permission to sign in with Slack, they can submit a request for an app's Sign in with Slack identity scope to share their Slack account credentials. If that service has a Slack app that offers other functionality, the app will need to be approved separately.\u00a0\n\nNote: Members will see the option to request Sign in with Slack permissions for apps that have been restricted for their workspace.\n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

Members will have 72 hours to bind their account before their link expires.\n\nAny members\u00a0already signed in when SSO is enabled will remain signed in.\u00a0Going forward, all members will sign in to Slack with their IDP account. If you chose to require SSO, your members will see a sign in page before they can access your workspace.\n\nTip:\u00a0To simplify member management, Slack supports the SCIM provisioning standard. Visit Manage members with SCIM provisioning to learn more.\n\n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

However, owners and admins can choose to restrict access to Workflow Builder. If you don\u2019t see this option, ask an owner or admin for more information.\n\nTip: Be sure to check out our Guide to Workflow Builder before diving into the tutorials.\n\nWhile you\u2019ll first be presented with picking a name for your workflow, the more important decision you\u2019ll need to make is how your workflow will start.\n\nThe trigger you pick for your workflow determines how it will start. Workflows are channel-specific, and can only be used in the channel you choose.\n\n*Creating workflows with webhooks requires some technical expertise.\n\nWorkflows in the shortcuts menu are easily accessible by members of a channel and can be used anytime. Workflows with other triggers that launch automatically are more contextual; you may want to consider the context of the action that launched them, and keep in mind that people may not be expecting them.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a trigger, you\u2019ll pick the channel where the workflow will be available and be prompted to further customize your workflow. What you need to do will depend on the trigger you chose.\u00a0\n\nFollow the steps below to open Workflow Builder and set up your workflow.\n\nFollow the steps for the trigger you selected to choose a channel for your workflow and finish setup.\n\nShortcut\n\nNew channel member\n\nEmoji\u00a0\n\nDate & time\n\n\ud83d\udccd Set up a workflow in Slack\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Add steps to a workflow\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Manage workflow collaborators\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Publish a workflow\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Manage a workflow\n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

Read on to learn how to send GIFs in Slack.\n\nNote: Common words and phrases can return unexpected results. Use with care!\n\nTip: The Find and share a GIF shortcut won't show up in the shortcuts menu from threads. To share GIFs in a thread, type the /giphy slash command in the message field, then add your search term and send your message to choose a GIF.\n\nIf you'd like, you can set a maximum GIF rating. Setting a GIF rating for the Giphy app determines the G-R rating of GIFs all members of your workspace will be able to view and send in Slack.\u00a0\n\n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

For example, to find a specific message, you might do the following:\u00a0\n\nNote: A folder will only be included in the export file if there are messages present for the date range you\u2019ve exported. For instance, if your retention policy is set to delete messages in public channels after 30 days and you selected a date range over 31 days ago, there would be no folders for public channels included in your export. \n\nEach folder in your ZIP file will contain different data from your workspace. The channels folder will include a TXT file of each channel and group direct message a single user has been a part of. The dms folder will include a TXT file of every one-to-one direct message a single user has been a part of.\n\nTXT files for conversations will be named after the channel, or after the usernames of members in the direct message.

If someone using Slack can\u2019t connect from a specific location, or if there\u2019s a WebSocket failure in our Slack connection test, you\u2019ll need to adjust your proxy or firewall to keep the connection to Slack open. Here\u2019s how:\n\nNetwork administrators can restrict access to specific Slack workspaces using proxy header injection on their network. The header injection solution has the same network requirements as above.\u00a0\n\nCertain software, security settings, and firewalls can interfere with Slack connections:\n\nSoftware \n\nAntivirus or ad-blocking software\n\nTemporarily turning off your antivirus or ad-blocking software may help you troubleshoot your connection issue.

These packages natively support all msiexec commands and are recommended for customers who need to deploy Slack to hundreds or thousands of machines. If you don't need to deploy Slack at large, download the desktop app.\n\nThe two MSI packages are fundamentally different, using different deployment and update mechanisms. Please read carefully before making your decision.\n\nThe MSI for per-user deployment adds the Slack Installer machine-wide, rather than individually installing Slack for Windows. The Slack Installer will only add Slack for Windows if it was never installed for the user currently logged into the machine.\n\nWho it's for:\n\nThis method is best for companies where employees work from their own machine or device and update Slack automatically.\n\nWho it's not for:\n\nCompanies where many people use the same machine (like terminal servers), or need to control which version of Slack is used, should use the MSI for machine-wide installation.\n\n Download 64-bit MSI Installer for per-user deployment\n\nNote: Looking for 32-bit? You'll need to use the 32-bit MSI Installer for machine-wide installation instead.\n\nThe MSI for single installation deployment installs Slack for Windows machine-wide, either to Program Files or a location of your choice. It is multi-client-capable, meaning that it can be used by multiple users on one machine, keeping their profiles separate in %ROAMINGAPPDATA%.\u00a0Using this method, Slack will not receive automatic updates.\n\nWho it's for:\n\nThis method is best for companies in which multiple employees use the same machine, like terminal servers, and/or need to control which version of Slack they use.\n\nWho it's not for:\n\nCompanies in which people use their own machines and update Slack automatically should use the MSI for per-user deployment.\n\n Download 32-bit MSI Installer for machine-wide installation\n\n Download 64-bit MSI Installer for machine-wide installation\n\nIt is important to stay up to date on new releases, as they provide users with valuable features and fixes. When installed using the machine-wide installer, Slack does not auto-update. In order to stay current with new Slack releases,\u00a0we have provided an RSS feed to notify you of new Windows Slack Desktop App updates: https://slack.com/release-notes/windows/rss.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Learn how to add RSS feeds to your Slack workflow.\n\nWe installed the 64-bit version of the MSI, but program files and registry entries were written to the 32-bit locations on our 64-bit system. What happened?\n\nUp to version 3.3.8 of Slack\u2019s desktop app, the MSI packages were compiled in 32-bit. However, their payload (Slack for Windows) is 64-bit. We realized this was confusing, so starting with version 3.4.0, both MSI tools will install 64-bit packages. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWe installed the per-user deployment MSI. Why does Slack not install for some or all users on certain machines?\n\nThe Slack deployment tool will only install Slack if it has not been previously installed by the user. If the deployment tool detects traces of previous installations it will back out. Specifically it looks for either of these folders:\u00a0 %APPDATA%\\slack or %PROGRAMDATA%\\slack. While the latter installation path is very rare, its presence would affect all users on the system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe installed the per-user deployment MSI. Why does it show up as a machine-wide installer in Apps and Features?\n\nThe per-user deployment MSI was named machine-wide installer before our current true machine-wide installer was released. The missing name change in the package was an oversight. Starting with version 3.4.0, the correct name will be displayed in Apps and Features.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe use the per-user deployment MSI. Do we need to update the Slack deployment tool when Slack itself auto-updates?\n\nWe uninstalled the per-user deployment MSI. Why is Slack still installed for all our users?\n\nUninstalling the MSI only removes the deployment tool and Slack will no longer install for new people logging into the computer. However, people who already installed Slack through the deployment tool need to manually uninstall the app. \n\nThis can be automated by calling \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\slack\\Update.exe\" --uninstall -s in the users context, e.g. during the logon script. If your machine hosts multiple users (e.g. a terminal server), then we recommend our machine-wide MSI which would uninstall Slack for all users automatically.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen installing newer versions of an MSI, older ones still show up. Are there multiple versions of Slack installed now?\n\nNo. While the Apps and Features list may show multiple versions of Slack, only the binaries of the latest version are installed. Starting with 3.4.0, older versions of Slack will be uninstalled when the installation of a new version begins. You\u2019ll continue to see versions pre-dating 3.4.0 in Apps and Features.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen silently uninstalling or updating the machine-wide MSI, why do machines reboot?\n\nWe introduced an upgrade feature to our MSI when version 3.4.0 was released, which uninstalls older versions of the MSI when you update to a later version. If an administrator triggers a silent update or uninstall while a logged-in user is using Slack, it will not be possible to delete the files component of the installation as it will be locked. When this happens, the MSI installer engine will stage the changes and trigger a reboot of the computer to push the changes.\u00a0To prevent unexpected reboots during silent installations, add /norestart to your install command line. That might look like msiexec /i \u201cslack-standalone-x.x.x.msi\u201d /qn /norestart. \n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

When you\u2019re done editing your workflow, publish your changes to make them available in your live workflow.\n\nWhile editing, you can take the following actions:\u00a0\n\nNote: It's not currently possible to change a workflow\u2019s trigger, but you can change the channel where a workflow starts from.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a direct message from Slackbot with a link to the file when it\u2019s ready.\n\nNote: In workflow form CSV files, the Z at the end of a Submission Timezone timestamp indicates the UTC timezone.\n\nTip:\u00a0Drag and drop steps in your workflow to re-order them.\n\nNote: If you delete a workflow, it will stop running for anyone currently using it.

If you need to get the attention of someone specific, you can mention that person directly.

Discover the power of apps and tools.\nApps are third-party services that you can connect with your Slack workspace. Each app has a unique set of permission scopes that tell you what information the app can access in Slack and how it can use that information. Use this guide to better understand app permissions and how to evaluate them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nApp permissions overview\u00a0\n\nAn app\u2019s scopes\u00a0depend on the kinds of things it was built to do. Generally, apps can do three things in Slack:\u00a0\n\nFor example, let's say you've installed two different apps to your workspace \u2014 Google Calendar and Twitter. The\u00a0Google Calendar app\u00a0helps your team manage their calendars and respond to meeting invites in Slack. The app may have access to your channels, member profiles, and messages to make sure meeting updates and event notifications end up in the right place.\n\nThe Twitter app\u00a0helps members of your workspace stay on top of your company's social activity by pulling notifications from Twitter into Slack. This app only has the ability to post messages to specific channels.\u00a0\n\nNote:\u00a0We recommend only choosing tools and services you trust when installing apps to Slack. Before adding an app, you can review its privacy policy from the app page in the Slack App Directory.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEvaluate app permissions\u00a0\n\nThere are two things you should consider when evaluating an app's permissions:\u00a0\n\nInstalled apps\n\nIf an app is already installed to your workspace, search for it from the Installed apps tab on your workspace's Apps page in the Slack App Directory to see who installed it and what information the app can access.\n\nNew apps\n\nBefore you install an app or approve an app installation request, you'll see a full list of permissions the app is requesting, including what information it can view and what actions it can take in your workspace.\n\nApps can take actions on behalf of a user or on behalf of the app. For example, an app may request permission to access messages in channels a user belongs to or post messages on their behalf. Apps can also take actions independently of users, like adding slash commands or posting messages as the app.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome apps create bot users in Slack. Bots can access the same information as workspace members, and may be able to take the same actions that members can.\n\nIf an app you're installing requests the bot scope, that means it's an older app that may have access to a wide range of actions and information in Slack.\u00a0Newer apps will request a narrower set of scopes that allow bots access to specific actions and information, regardless of whether an app has updated its bot user or not.\n\n\u00a0\n\nView access types\u00a0\n\nAccess types help you understand the kind of information an app can view in Slack. Workspace Owners and Admins can filter apps by access type from the Approved apps,\u00a0Restricted apps, or\u00a0Installed apps tabs on the Apps page in the App Directory:\u00a0\n\n Awesome!\nThanks so much for your feedback!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nGot it!\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nIf you\u2019d like a member of our support team to respond to you, please send a note to feedback@slack.com.\nOops!

When you install the Slack app to your employees\u2019 machines, the app will install to the /Applications folder and update automatically whenever a new version is released. \n\nNote: If you disable automatic updates, we recommend updating the app regularly to make sure you\u2019re running the most secure version and have access to new features.\n\nSlack can be used by multiple users on the same machine. You can install Slack to a user\u2019s /Applications or ~/Applications folder. Compare the two methods below to determine which installation is right for your organization.\n\n/Applications\n\n~/Applications\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected an installation type, download a build of the Slack desktop app. There are three possible builds: the Intel (x64) build, the Apple Silicon (arm64) build, and the Universal build (x64 or arm64). When distributing Slack, ensure you\u2019re using the correct version of the Slack app for your employees\u2019 machines.\n\nNote: The Universal build works on Intel and Apple Silicon machines. Keep in mind the installation file is much larger than the other builds.\n\nYou can disable automatic updates on a per-user basis. This is helpful for testing new versions of the Slack app before releasing them, or for gradually rolling out app updates. To maintain app reliability and security, we recommend updating Slack whenever a new app version is released.\n\nTo prevent Slack from automatically checking for updates, run the following terminal command as each user who will be running Slack:\n\ndefaults write /Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap.plist SlackNoAutoUpdates -bool YES\n\nUse the following command to re-enable automatic updates:\u00a0\n\ndefaults write /Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap.plist SlackNoAutoUpdates -bool NO\n\nIf Slack is installed to ~/Applications, users can update the app without special permissions. If Slack is installed to /Applications, users must be administrators of their Mac machines and have write access to slack.app and all files beneath it in order to update the app.\n\nOn a shared machine, we recommend creating a permissions group for all Slack users. You can then grant ownership and write access to that permissions group using the following terminal command. Replace example with the name of your permission group:\n\nchown -R :example /Applications/Slack.app && chmod -R 755 /Applications/Slack.app\n\nTip: We have an RSS feed to notify you of Slack desktop app updates for Mac.

Discover the power of apps and tools.\nUse Salesforce and Slack together to manage your sales pipeline or customer service more efficiently. The Salesforce app for Slack is available for all Salesforce Editions (except Salesforce Essentials) and supports Sales Cloud and Service Cloud on both the Lightning and Classic Experiences.\n\nNote:\u00a0We've released a new version of the Salesforce app for Slack, and ended support for the legacy version in May 2020.\u00a0\n\nThere are two apps that connect Salesforce and Slack. Each app provides different functionality:\n\nIn order to use the Salesforce app for Slack, a Salesforce System Administrator will first need to install and configure the Slack app for Salesforce.\n\nIn October 2019, we released a new version of the Salesforce app to our App Directory, along with an updated Slack package for Salesforce. Slack customers who installed the legacy Salesforce app before October 2019 can follow the steps below to remove the legacy app and test the new app before starting the installation and configuration process.\n\nTip: If you never used the legacy Salesforce app, skip ahead to install the current version of the app.\n\nTo ensure that your migration goes smoothly, we recommend following this checklist:\n\nNote:\u00a0When you install the new Salesforce app, the /salesforce slash command will immediately be linked to the new app. Remove the legacy app before installing the new app to avoid any errors.\n\nWhen you're ready to migrate, follow the steps below to remove the legacy Salesforce app from your workspace:\n\nIf you used the Salesforce Chatter Connector along with the legacy app, you'll need to remove it from your workspace by following the same steps above.\n\nFollow the steps below to install the new Slack package to Salesforce and the new Salesforce app to Slack.\n\nOnce you've removed the legacy app from Slack, installed the new app, and added the new Slack package to Salesforce, there are two final steps to complete your migration:\n\n\u00a0\n\nSalesforce System Administrators can visit Configure Salesforce for use with Slack to install the Slack package in Salesforce, configure standard and custom objects, set user permissions, and more. Once that\u2019s complete, members can follow the steps below to install the Salesforce app to Slack or connect their accounts if the app has already been installed to their workspace.\n\nTip: If you\u2019re on Slack's Enterprise Grid plan, you can install the Salesforce app at the org level and add it to any workspaces that need access to Salesforce from the admin dashboard.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCheck with a Salesforce System Administrator to make sure the Slack app for Salesforce has been installed and properly configured before installing the Salesforce app to your Slack workspace.\n\nTip: Before connecting Slack to your production Salesforce instance, you can test your setup. To do so, click the\u00a0Connect to a Salesforce sandbox org? link below the Add to Slack button on the app landing page.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce both apps have been installed, connect your Salesforce and Slack accounts.\n\nNote:\u00a0You can also connect Slack and Salesforce by clicking on a Salesforce alert in a channel, then following the prompts to authenticate Slack with your Salesforce account.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy default, the Salesforce app will return search results for six standard Salesforce objects:\n\nYou may be able to search for standard objects not included in the list above and custom objects if your Salesforce System Administrator has configured them in Salesforce. We recommend contacting your System Administrator if you\u2019d like to request access to additional standard or custom objects in Slack.\n\nTo search for and share a Salesforce record in Slack, follow the steps below:\n\nThere are three types of Salesforce alerts you can set up in your workspace:\n\nNote: Salesforce alerts in both public and private channels will appear as messages from you, since the Salesforce app may not have access to all channels in your workspace.\u00a0\n\nBy default, you\u2019ll receive a message from the Salesforce app when a record is assigned to you in Salesforce. To manage other alerts for standard and custom object record changes in Slack, follow the steps below:\n\nTo post Salesforce record changes to a channel in Slack, you can set up a channel alert:\n\nTip: To set up a channel alert from Salesforce, click the Slack Alerts button from any record and select a channel.\n\nCreate a bulk alert to post updates about all records of a particular type to a channel.\n\nNote: If alerts you\u2019ve set up stop working, ask your Salesforce System Administrator to reauthorize the connection to Slack from System Connections in the Slack Setup assistant. If that doesn\u2019t fix the problem, contact our Support team for help.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhether you\u2019re working in Slack or Salesforce, it\u2019s easy to send relevant information between services.\u00a0\n\nUse the Add to Salesforce message shortcut\u00a0to attach a Slack message to the Related Slack Messages\u00a0component of any record in Salesforce.\n\nUse the Send to Slack\u00a0action to send records from Salesforce to Slack.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you no longer want to use the Salesforce app in Slack, you can disconnect your account.
